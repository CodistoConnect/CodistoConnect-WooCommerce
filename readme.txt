== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Codisto LINQ work with all Amazon & eBay sites? =

Yes, it does.

= What are the requirements to run Codisto LINQ? =

Codisto LINQ requires a recent version of WordPress (4.2+) with WooCommerce (2.2+) installed. Your server should run on Linux and have PHP 5.3.

= Does Codisto LINQ just list my products on Amazon/eBay or provide full catalog synchronization? =

Codisto LINQ is more than just a listing tool. It keeps your whole catalog – products, prices, images, descriptions, inventory levels and more in sync with Amazon/eBay in real time. Orders from Amazon/eBay are automatically sent to WooCommerce and inventory reduced in real time so you never oversell on either channel.  Further, you can of course choose which products from your catalog to list.

= How easy is Codisto LINQ to setup and use? =

Codisto LINQ was designed for merchants to increase their sales by adding the Amazon & eBay channels for virtually no effort and keep their current WooCommerce fulfilment processes.
This has been achieved by applying the maximum automation to setting up and managing Amazon/eBay. There are many areas of automation from categorizing products on eBay, applying a professional template, upscaling images, UPC/EAN error prevention, automatic tax rate detection for orders and many more.
If you’re happy with our standard template, eBay best practice selling values e.g. 30 days returns and free shipping, once Codisto LINQ has installed, you can list your entire catalog in just 4 clicks.
Amazon ASIN matches is fully automated if you have UPC data and there is a quick and easy search tool if you don’t have UPC data. There is no better performing solution that makes it as easy to list on Amazon/eBay anywhere, let alone offer full, real time integration.

= I already have listed my products on Amazon/eBay. Can Codisto LINQ import them to WooCommerce? =

No, Codisto LINQ is designed to let WooCommerce be the “source of true” – you contine to manage your products in WordPress – and use Codisto LINQ to manage which products and how they are listed on Amazon/eBay.
But it is possible to map existing Amazon/eBay listings to products in WooCommerce once they are in WooCommerce with the ‘map products’ function.

= Does Codisto LINQ support auction style listings? =

No, Codisto LINQ is designed for merchants with catalogs who want to create fixed price, good til cancelled listings.
