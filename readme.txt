== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long does it take to set up and start selling? =

Because Multichannel for WooCommerce sits inside your existing WooCommerce platform there’s no data migration to a separate multi-channel platform required which can save days or even weeks of setup time.

With Multichannel for WooCommerce, installation and connecting a sales channel takes about a minute. Setting default listing values takes another minute or so. If you are happy listing all products with default values there is nothing more to do except enable the products (in bulk) you want to list (or link to existing listings).

Amazon, Walmart and eBay limit the speed of listing hundreds or thousands of products to a certain rate per minute but a few thousand products are listed in about an hour. Google Merchant Centre can take up to 3 days to verify your products. If you wish to configure certain products away from the default values, setup time is dependent on how many changes you are making but all changes can be done in bulk. It’s rare that merchants take any more than an hour or so for the most complicated configurations and everyone is normally selling same day.

= Does Multichannel for WooCommerce support all Amazon, Google and eBay sales channels globally and all WooCommerce store currencies? =

Yes. Multichannel for WooCommerce supports listings on all Google, Amazon and eBay sites around the world all from within WooCommerce, and listing for approved sellers on Walmart US.

Multichannel for WooCommerce supports all store currencies and you can use our in-built currency manager to list on sales channels in different currencies.

= Can I set separate price and quantity rules, titles and descriptions? =

Yes. It’s easy to set different rules for sales channel listings different to those used on your webstore and quickly apply them in bulk using in built operators or mapping fields from WooCommerce.

= What do you mean by real-time sync? =

Multichannel for WooCommerce sync is ‘event driven’. This means as soon as something happens like an item gets sold or a price gets changed, it is constantly ‘listening’ and reacts as soon as the message that something has changed is received, which means you can’t oversell or sell at the wrong price because we avoid the need for scheduled sync events. This is different from alternative approaches which run event changes on scheduled frequencies e.g. every hour. A scheduled sync approach means you are always out of sync between schedules.

= I already have listed my products on Amazon/eBay. Can Codisto LINQ import them to WooCommerce? =

No, Codisto LINQ is designed to let WooCommerce be the “source of true” – you contine to manage your products in WordPress – and use Codisto LINQ to manage which products and how they are listed on Amazon/eBay.
But it is possible to map existing Amazon/eBay listings to products in WooCommerce once they are in WooCommerce with the ‘map products’ function.

= Does Multichannel for WooCommerce work with other third-party apps? =

Multichannel for WooCommerce works well with common third-party extensions e.g. shipping integrations. Multichannel for WooCommerce ‘should’ work well with other third-party apps due to our rigorous adherence to app development guidelines.

However, we cannot guarantee all third-party apps have been developed in accordance with the guidelines and given the large number it is impossible to test all. If you are using a third-party app that you are already using and suspect may cause a conflict we suggest testing Multichannel for WooCommerce with a small number or products/orders first and reach out to support if you experience any difficulties.

= I have Amazon/eBay listings and want to create an online store, can Multichannel for WooCommerce do that for me? =

No. Multichannel for WooCommerce uses your online store product catalog as the ‘source of truth’ to sync with Amazon/eBay. There are third-party importer tools available to create products in WooCommerce (search Google or app store). You can then use Multichannel for WooCommerce to create/link and sync your WooCommerce products with Google, Amazon, Walmart and eBay.

= Do you mark orders as coming from Google, Amazon, Walmart or eBay when you sync them with WooCommerce? =

Yes. Multichannel for WooCommerce marks orders and puts them into Google, Amazon, Walmart and eBay customer groups in WooCommerce.

= How does the free trial work? =

You can use Multichannel for WooCommerce free for 14 days. No credit card is required to install and configure (‘click around’). We ask you to choose a plan and enter credit card when you list/link your first item(s).

Nothing gets charged during the free trial period but we need a payment method in place should you decided to continue with Multichannel for WooCommerce at the end of the free trial period so that sync isn’t interrupted as you move from free trial to paying subscription.

If you want to cancel at any time during the free trial simply email support@codisto.com and nothing will ever get charged.

= What happens at end of trial? =

If you choose to continue with Multichannel for WooCommerce at the end of the free trial, we will charge your credit card for the plan selected. If you choose to cancel during the free trial period (email support@codisto.com), we’ll end sync and not charge you. Any listings created during the free trial remain active at the end of the trial (we never end them), but they are no longer kept in sync with WooCommerce.

= What’s included in the free trial? =

Everything. The product you use during your free trial is the same product you would use as a paying subscription.

= Can I upgrade/downgrade anytime? =

Yes. You can choose to upgrade or downgrade plans at any time by selecting the appropriate plan within the app.

= Are there any contracts? =

No. There’s no contract – just pay as you go, month-to-month. You can cancel at any time without penalty.

= Are there any setup fees? =

There are no setup fees or hidden charges with any of our plans.

= What if I go over my plan limits? =

To find out more about the specific overages and inclusions in your plan, please visit the Codisto pricing page.

= What kind of payments do you accept? =

We accept Visa and Mastercard.

= Do I need my credit card info to sign up? =

No. You can install and experience Multichannel for WooCommerce without a credit card. We ask you to choose a plan and enter credit card when you list/link your first item(s).

Nothing gets charged during the free trial period but we need a payment method in place should you decided to continue with Multichannel for WooCommerce at the end of the free trial period so that sync isn’t interrupted as you move from free trial to paying subscription. If you want to cancel at any time, email support@codisto.com.

= Can I cancel anytime? =

Yes. If you ever decide that Multichannel for WooCommerce isn’t the best Amazon/eBay integration solution for your business, simply cancel by emailing support@codisto.com. We never end any listings when you cancel, they are just not kept in sync any longer.

= Do I need my own Google, Amazon, Walmart or eBay account to use Multichannel for WooCommerce? =

Yes. Multichannel for WooCommerce connects your online store to your Google/Amazon/eBay/Walmart account(s). You need an Amazon Professional Seller account (you can’t use an individual account because Amazon doesn’t allow third-party connections) or an eBay seller account (list any item on eBay manually once and eBay automatically turn an eBay buyer account into an eBay seller account). For Walmart, you will need a Walmart account and be approved to sell by applying directly to Walmart as a seller. If you do not have a Google account or Google Merchant Center account, one can be created for you automatically. You are responsible for any Google/Amazon/eBay fees – these are separate to Multichannel for WooCommerce charges.

= Can I use multiple Google/Amazon/eBay/Walmart accounts? =

Yes. Multichannel for WooCommerce supports multi Google/Amazon/eBay account, multi Google/Amazon/eBay site and multi-store use

= I operate two stores, do I need two Multichannel for WooCommerce subscriptions? =

Multichannel for WooCommerce works on a ‘per instance’ basis so you need more than one subscription unless you have multiple stores on the same instance.

= What is your support like? =

Support is available 24/7 by email, chat. Phone support is available for Channel Cloud Plus customers.

= Why is Multichannel for WooCommerce a monthly fee not a one-time software purchase? =

Multichannel for WooCommerce is constantly ‘listening’ and reacting to any changes made on sales channels or your platform to ensure sync is maintained. This architecture is the only way to provide the performance demanded by professional online sellers. This requires a lot of server resources that we get charged on a monthly basis for by Amazon Web Services.

Also, sales channels and platforms and regularly changing their offerings in terms of features, meta data or APIs (what we use to connect stores to sales channels). Furthermore, we are having to constantly reinvest to develop new features and maintain the solution to ensure it works for all sites and platforms supported. We also provide 24/7 support. All of this is included in the monthly fee.

= Do I need to end my current eBay listings to use Multichannel for WooCommerce? =

No. Multichannel for WooCommerce understands the importance of retaining your current listings. During the installation flow we prompt you to ‘Link Existing eBay Listings’ which guides you through how to link your existing eBay listings to your eCommerce products. This can be done in bulk in a few clicks.

= Do you end listings if I cancel Multichannel for WooCommerce? =

No. Listings are never ended if you cancel your Codisto subscription for Multichannel for WooCommerce, they are just no longer kept in sync with WooCommerce and no orders are transferred to WooCommerce.

= Why does Multichannel for WooCommerce offer a Flexi plan with a variable % (+1.9% of sales channels sales) and how does this work? =

Some merchants are unsure how their products will sell on sales channels, but they have a lot of products they want to list and try selling. The idea of the flexi plan is to give merchants a low commitment way of trying sales channel selling.

Once sales are known or it becomes cheaper to move to a fixed plan, simply change plans in app. This can be done at any time. Merchants on the flexi plan get charged the fixed portion in advance and the variable portion in arrears.

= Can I list selected products or part of my catalog or do I have to list the entire catalog? =

You can choose what you want to list, individually or in bulk. Filtering and bulk edit makes it very fast to list any number of products.

= Can I use Multichannel for WooCommerce just for order sync from Amazon/eBay/Walmart to WooCommerce? =

Absolutely. You don’t need to list anything with Multichannel for WooCommerce to take advantage of sales channel order sync – set to “all orders” in the orders settings screen.

= Are there any more FAQ? =

Yes, there are! Please check out our growing knowledgebase at <http://help.codisto.com/>
